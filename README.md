# Routing-in-Angular
Routing means navigating to different pages in our app. In AngularJS, we can use ngRoute module to do routing, and also keep out app as a Single Page Application(with no page loading).
We need:

1. include angular-route.js. < script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/angularjs/1.4.8/angular-route.js"></ script>
2. add ngRoute as a dependency in the app. var app = angular.module("myApp", ["ngRoute"]);
